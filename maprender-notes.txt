This file just has some notes relating to maprender.py
They were originally comments, but I've moved them here so they
don't clutter the script so much.


try to make spelling consistant

Use slices to run down block columns perhaps?

think about 1.7 - 1.8 id compatability

it seems in 1.8 (snapshot) the item frame TileX, Y, Z are of the block
the item frame is in, not the one it's on.
1.8 fixes 1.7-made item frame entities when they are loaded
it tells 1.7 ones apart from 1.8 ones by whether the item frame entity
has a "Direction" tag or not. I think it removes these in 1.8, replacing
it with "Facing". Might need to make two scripts/ an option for pre-1.8/1.8
"Dir" is also removed in 1.8

I should really just support 1.7, as I don't have the map colours for 1.8 anyway.
Or I should make a 1.8-mode tick box. But the conversion bug should be squelched soon hopefully.

in 14w30c map rotations go up to 7 even though visually there are
only 4 rotations, due to a bug, and new 45 degree rotations.

The map rendering is not perfect because when there is a tie
pythons Counter does not give the same order as
Guava's HashMultiet
